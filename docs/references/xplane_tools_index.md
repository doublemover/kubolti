# X-Plane Tools Index

Source: https://developer.x-plane.com/tools/

## Why it matters
The tools index is the canonical landing page for X-Plane utilities beyond XPTools. Most are optional but useful for manual validation or asset prep.

## Relevant tools
- WorldEditor (WED): edits scenery packs and airports; helpful for inspecting output scenery.
- Blender add-on: import/export X-Plane objects; useful if custom mesh assets are needed.
- Substance Painter plugin: texture authoring workflow; optional for terrain texture work.
- DataRefEditor: runtime data inspector; useful for debugging X-Plane behavior.

## Current stance
- DEM2DSF does not integrate these tools directly today.
- XPTools already covers DSFTool/DDSTool/XGrinder, which are the only tools used in the pipeline.

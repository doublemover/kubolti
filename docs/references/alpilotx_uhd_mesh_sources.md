# UHD Mesh Scenery Data Sources

## Why it matters
The UHD mesh data sources list could inform preferred DEM inputs or quality notes.

## Key points
- Archived page lists elevation sources used for UHD Mesh Scenery v1.
- Elevation data sources cited: Viewfinderpanoramas 30m/1sec (Alps, Scandinavia), NED 30m (USA, Canada), SRTM 1sec (Pyrenees), ALOS AW3D (Japan).
- OSM data vintages are called out for some regions (end of April 2015 for several Europe/Canada packs, mid March 2016 for Japan).
- Other inputs are described as matching HD Mesh Scenery v3.

## Gotchas
- Data sources are mixed/merged rather than used as raw inputs, so provenance is per-region and not one-to-one.
